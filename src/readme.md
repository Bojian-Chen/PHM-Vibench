# 🏛️ PHM-Vibench Source Code Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the source code structure.

> NOTE: The maintained user-facing entrypoint is `python main.py --config <yaml> [--override key=value ...]`.
> Pipelines are selected by the YAML top-level `pipeline:` field (not by a `--pipeline` CLI flag).
> Running `python -m src.Pipeline_*` is considered a developer/debug path and may lag behind the main CLI docs.

## Core Philosophy: The Factory Pattern 🏭

The entire framework is built around a **Factory design pattern**. This means that the core components—data, models, and training logic—are decoupled into independent modules. A "factory" is responsible for assembling a specific component based on a configuration file. This powerful design choice allows you to:

* **Plug & Play**: Easily add new datasets, models, or training tasks with minimal code changes.
* **Experiment Rapidly**: Mix and match components by simply editing a YAML configuration file.
* **Maintain Clean Code**: Keep the concerns of data handling, modeling, and training neatly separated.

## 🧩 Module Breakdown

The `src/` directory is organized into four main factories and a utilities folder.



| Directory | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| `data_factory/` | **Handles all data I/O**. It reads raw data, applies preprocessing, and serves it through `DataLoader` objects. |
| `model_factory/` | **Builds the neural network**. It dynamically loads and initializes a specified model architecture. |
| `task_factory/` | **Encapsulates the training logic**. It connects the model and data to a `LightningModule`, defining the loss functions, metrics, and optimization steps. |
| `trainer_factory/` | **Configures the training engine**. It sets up the PyTorch Lightning `Trainer`, including callbacks (like checkpointing) and loggers (like Wandb). |
| `utils/` | Contains shared helper functions, such as configuration management and other common utilities, used across the framework. |

## 🌊 Execution Workflow

An experiment in Vibench is executed by a top-level pipeline script (e.g., `Pipeline_01_default.py`), which orchestrates the factories in a specific order:

1.  **Configuration Loading**: The pipeline starts by loading a YAML configuration file from the `configs/` directory. This file dictates which components to use for the experiment.
2.  **Data Loading**: The `data_factory` is called to prepare the training, validation, and test `DataLoaders` along with dataset metadata.
3.  **Model Initialization**: The `model_factory` is called to construct the neural network specified in the config.
4.  **Task Assembly**: The `task_factory` takes the model and configurations to build the `LightningModule`, which defines the complete training and evaluation logic.
5.  **Trainer Setup**: The `trainer_factory` creates the `pl.Trainer` instance, configuring callbacks, loggers, and hardware settings.
6.  **Execution**: Finally, the pipeline calls `.fit()` on the `Trainer` with the assembled task and data modules to run the experiment.

## 🧭 Pipelines Overview (What To Use When)

Vibench ships multiple pipelines tailored to different experiment shapes. Choose based on your goal and stage structure.

### Pipeline_01_default
- Purpose: Single‑stage, single‑task training. Ideal for domain generalization/classification/regression baselines.
- Flow: load_config → build_data → build_model → build_task → build_trainer → fit → test (best checkpoint).
- When to use: Fast baselines, ablations, dataset readers/model bring‑up.
- Run:
  - `python main.py --config configs/demo/01_cross_domain/cwru_dg.yaml`
  - Smoke (no downloads): `python main.py --config configs/demo/00_smoke/dummy_dg.yaml`

### Pipeline_02_pretrain_fewshot
- Purpose: Two‑stage training (pretraining on source → few‑shot adaptation). Supports K‑shot episodes and checkpoint hand‑off.
- Flow: run_pretraining_stage(config) → collect best ckpts → run_fewshot_stage(fs_config, ckpts).
- Notable: Can control multiple iterations; passes checkpoint paths into stage 2 automatically.
- When to use: Cross‑machine few‑shot transfer; target system with limited labels.
- Run:
  - `python main.py --config configs/demo/05_pretrain_fewshot/pretrain_hse_then_fewshot.yaml`

### Pipeline_03_multitask_pretrain_finetune
- Purpose: Two‑stage multi‑task pipeline (unsupervised/masked pretraining → supervised fine‑tuning). Supports backbone comparison and multi‑task heads.
- Flow: create_pretraining_config → train (stage 1) → create_finetuning_config → fine‑tune (single‑task and/or multi‑task) with best ckpts.
- Notable: Compares backbones (e.g., PatchTST, FNO, DLinear, TimesNet); produces structured results and summaries.
- When to use: Foundation‑model style experiments; larger studies that require controlled stage‑by‑stage configs.
- Run:
  - (Advanced) Prefer a dedicated YAML under `configs/` that selects `pipeline: Pipeline_03_multitask_pretrain_finetune`.
  - Use `python -m scripts.config_inspect --config <yaml>` to verify resolved config + instantiation targets.

### Pipeline_04_unified_metric
- Status: legacy/experimental. Historical docs may reference `script/unified_metric/`, but that directory is not part of the maintained workflow of this repo.
- If you need unified-metric experiments, keep them in a paper/research submodule and avoid mixing them into the core `configs/demo/` onboarding path.

### Pipeline_ID
- Purpose: Alias pipeline that routes to the default pipeline while using ID‑based data ingestion (id_data_factory).
- When to use: If your config selects the ID dataset implementation and you prefer a distinct entry name.
- Run:
  - `python main.py --config <your_config.yaml>`

---

## 🗂️ Local Overrides Across Machines
- For cross‑device paths (e.g., `data.data_dir`), keep the main YAML portable and place machine‑specific settings in `configs/local/local.yaml`, or pass `--local_config`.
- All pipelines automatically merge base YAML with `configs/local/local.yaml` if present; no hostname or environment variables required.

## 🚀 How to Extend Vbench

Adding your own custom components is the primary way to leverage the power of Vbench. Here’s where to start:

* **To Add a New Dataset**:
    1.  Create a new reader script in `src/data_factory/reader/`.
    2.  Follow the instructions in `src/data_factory/contributing.md`.
* **To Add a New Model**:
    1.  Implement your architecture in a new file under `src/model_factory/`. Create a new subdirectory if it belongs to a new family of models.
    2.  Ensure your model class is named `Model` and can be initialized with the configuration `args`.
* **To Add a New Task**:
    1.  Create a new module in `src/task_factory/task/` that defines the data splits, loss functions, and metrics for your specific problem.
* **To Add a Custom Trainer**:
    1.  Extend the functionality by creating a new trainer configuration script in `src/trainer_factory/`.

For each new component, you can use the existing modules as templates to understand the required interfaces. Once your code is in place, simply update a YAML configuration file to tell Vbench to use your new module in an experiment.
