# dev/

This directory contains development utilities and historical notes.

## What belongs here

- One-off scripts, refactors-in-progress, and internal experiment notes that should not affect the maintained workflow.
- Historical test runners live under `dev/test_history/` (optional; not a validation gate).

## Start here (maintained workflow)

- Canonical onboarding: `README.md`
- Config system + runnable templates: `configs/README.md` and `configs/demo/`
- Commands + validation gates: `AGENTS.md`
